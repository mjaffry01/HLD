        <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Summary</h2>
        <p>
            Caching is a fundamental technique used to enhance the performance and efficiency of web applications by temporarily storing frequently accessed data closer to the user or processor. This reduces latency, minimizes database load, and ensures faster data retrieval. Caching mechanisms operate at various levels, including browsers, Content Delivery Networks (CDNs), and application servers. Effective caching strategies are essential for maintaining data consistency, managing storage overhead, and ensuring scalability in high-traffic environments. This lecture explores the intricacies of caching, its types, practical applications, challenges, and strategies to maintain synchronization between caches and databases.

            <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> What is the primary purpose of caching in web applications?</h2>
            <p>
                The primary purpose of caching in web applications is to enhance performance by storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage medium. This reduces the time it takes to retrieve data, minimizes latency, and decreases the load on backend systems such as databases or external services. By serving data from the cache, applications can respond to user requests more quickly and handle higher traffic efficiently.

            <p>
                When a browser accesses a URL like <code>google.com</code>, the following sequence of events occurs:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>DNS Lookup</strong>: The browser checks its DNS cache to find the IP address associated with <code>google.com</code>. If not found, it queries a DNS server.</li>
                <li><strong>IP Address Retrieval</strong>: The DNS server responds with the IP address of the server hosting <code>google.com</code>.</li>
                <li><strong>Establishing Connection</strong>: The browser initiates a TCP connection to the server's IP address, typically on port 80 (HTTP) or 443 (HTTPS).</li>
                <li><strong>Sending HTTP Request</strong>: The browser sends an HTTP request to the server, asking for the specific resource (e.g., homepage).</li>
                <li><strong>Server Response</strong>: The server processes the request and sends back the requested data, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images.</li>
                <li><strong>Rendering</strong>: The browser parses the received data and renders the webpage for the user to view.</li>

            <p>
                L1 and L2 caches are levels of CPU cache memory that store frequently accessed data to speed up processing. The key differences in terms of latency are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>L1 Cache</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Located closest to the CPU cores.</li>
                        <li>Smaller in size (typically 16KB to 64KB per core).</li>
                        <li>Extremely low latency (~0.5 nanoseconds).</li>
                        <li>Used for storing the most frequently accessed data and instructions.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>L2 Cache</strong>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Located between the CPU cores and the main memory.</li>
                        <li>Larger in size (typically 256KB to 1MB per core).</li>
                        <li>Higher latency (~7 nanoseconds) compared to L1 cache.</li>
                        <li>Stores data that is less frequently accessed than what is stored in L1 cache.</li>
                    </ul>

        <div id="question5">
            <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-network-wired"></i> Name and describe two types of caching mechanisms used by browsers.</h2>
            <p>
                Browsers utilize several caching mechanisms to improve performance by reducing the need to fetch resources repeatedly from the server. Two primary types are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>HTTP Cache</strong>:
                    <p>
                        Stores responses to HTTP requests (like HTML pages, images, CSS, JavaScript) based on caching headers (e.g., <code>Cache-Control</code>, <code>Expires</code>). When the same resource is requested again, the browser can serve it from the cache instead of fetching it from the network, reducing load times.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>DNS Cache</strong>:
                    <p>
                        Caches the mapping of domain names to IP addresses. By storing DNS query results, the browser can quickly resolve domain names without performing a new DNS lookup each time, thereby decreasing latency and speeding up access to websites.
                    </p>
                </li>

                <li><strong>Facebook Newsfeed</strong>
                    <p>
                        Facebook caches users' newsfeeds in RAM to deliver personalized content quickly. By storing frequently accessed data in memory, Facebook can serve newsfeeds without repeatedly querying the database, ensuring fast load times even with millions of users.

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Consistency</strong>: Ensuring that cached data remains synchronized with the original data source can be complex, especially across multiple caching layers and geographical locations. Inconsistencies can lead to outdated or incorrect data being served to users.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Invalidation</strong>: Determining when to update or remove cached data is challenging. Improper invalidation strategies can result in stale data or unnecessary cache misses.</li>
                <li><strong>Storage Overhead</strong>: Caching requires additional storage resources, which can increase costs and infrastructure complexity. Managing cache size and ensuring efficient use of storage is essential.</li>
                <li><strong>Cache Misses</strong>: When requested data is not found in the cache, it leads to cache misses, resulting in slower data retrieval from the original source. Minimizing cache misses is crucial for maintaining performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: As the user base grows, scaling the caching infrastructure to handle increased load without compromising performance becomes a significant challenge.</li>

            <p>
                Facebook employs a sophisticated multi-level caching strategy to enhance performance and scalability. The caching system includes:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>L1 Cache</strong>: Managed by TAO clients, L1 cache is the first layer of caching. It stores frequently accessed data close to the application servers, ensuring quick data retrieval.</li>
                <li><strong>L2 Cache</strong>: Managed by Memcache, L2 cache is a distributed caching system that handles a larger volume of data. It serves as a secondary cache layer, reducing the load on the primary data stores by serving cached data to multiple application servers.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Additionally, Facebook uses CacheLib, an open-source caching engine, to build and scale high-performance cache services. CacheLib provides a thread-safe API for high throughput and low overhead, enabling efficient handling of web-scale services.

                        <li><strong>Process</strong>: Data is written to both the cache and the database simultaneously.</li>
                        <li><strong>Pros</strong>: Ensures that the cache always has the latest data, maintaining consistency between the cache and the database.</li>
                        <li><strong>Cons</strong>: Slower write operations due to the need to write data to both cache and database.</li>

                A <strong>cache miss</strong> occurs when the requested data is not found in the cache, forcing the system to retrieve the data from a slower storage layer, such as the main memory or disk. There are three types of cache misses:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Compulsory Miss</strong>: Occurs when data is accessed for the first time and is not present in the cache.</li>
                <li><strong>Capacity Miss</strong>: Happens when the cache is too small to hold all the data needed, causing older data to be evicted and later accessed again.</li>
                <li><strong>Conflict Miss</strong>: Arises in set-associative or direct-mapped caches when multiple data blocks compete for the same cache line.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Minimizing cache misses is crucial because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Performance</strong>: Cache misses lead to longer data retrieval times, which can degrade application performance and user experience.</li>
                <li><strong>Resource Utilization</strong>: Frequent cache misses increase the load on backend systems like databases, potentially causing bottlenecks and reducing overall system efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: Reducing cache misses helps in scaling applications to handle higher loads without compromising performance.</li>

            <p>
                Hierarchical caching involves using multiple levels of caches, each with different storage capacities and access speeds, to optimize both storage utilization and performance. Here's how it works:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Multiple Cache Levels</strong>: Typically, there are several cache levels (e.g., L1, L2, L3), each closer to the CPU or user and varying in size and speed.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Placement</strong>: Frequently accessed data is stored in the faster, smaller caches (e.g., L1), while less frequently accessed data is stored in larger, slower caches (e.g., L2 or L3).</li>
                <li><strong>Reduced Latency</strong>: By having data available at multiple cache levels, the system can retrieve it from the closest and fastest cache, minimizing access time.</li>
                <li><strong>Efficient Storage Use</strong>: Hierarchical caching ensures that storage resources are utilized efficiently by distributing data based on access patterns and frequency.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability</strong>: It allows the system to scale performance without exponentially increasing cache sizes, as data is managed across different cache layers.</li>

        <div id="question13">
            <h2 class="section-title"><i class="fas fa-sync-alt"></i> Why is data consistency a critical issue in caching systems, and how can it be maintained?</h2>
            <p>
                <strong>Data Consistency</strong> ensures that cached data remains synchronized with the original data source. It is critical because inconsistencies can lead to outdated or incorrect information being served to users, undermining the reliability and integrity of applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Maintaining data consistency in caching systems involves several strategies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cache Invalidation</strong>:
                    <p>
                        Mechanisms to invalidate or update cache entries when the underlying data changes. Common approaches include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Time-to-Live (TTL)</strong>: Sets an expiration time for cached data, after which it is considered stale and refreshed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Event-Based Invalidation</strong>: Triggers cache updates or invalidations based on specific events or changes in the data source.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Write-Through and Write-Back Strategies</strong>:
                    <p>
                        Ensuring that write operations update both the cache and the data source appropriately to maintain consistency.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Versioning</strong>:
                    <p>
                        Using version numbers or timestamps to track changes in data, allowing the cache to determine if its entries are up-to-date.</p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Push Updates</strong>:
                    <p>
                        Automatically pushing updates to all cache nodes when the original data changes, ensuring immediate consistency across caches.</p>

            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Eviction Policies</strong>
                    <p>
                        Implementing policies like Least Recently Used (LRU), Least Frequently Used (LFU), or First-In-First-Out (FIFO) to determine which data to remove from the cache when space is needed.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Scaling the Cache</strong>
                    <p>

                </li>
                <li><strong>Data Compression</strong>
                    <p>
                        Compressing cached data to reduce its size, allowing more data to be stored within the same cache space.

                <strong>Hierarchical Caching</strong> and <strong>Global Caching</strong> are two distinct caching strategies used to optimize data retrieval and system performance.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hierarchical Caching</strong>
                    <p>
                        Involves multiple levels of caches with varying sizes and speeds, arranged in a hierarchy. Data flows through these levels based on access patterns:
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>L1 Cache</strong>: Small and fast, located close to the processor or application server.</li>
                            <li><strong>L2 Cache</strong>: Larger and slightly slower, acting as a secondary cache layer.</li>
